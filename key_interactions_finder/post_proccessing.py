"""
Post processes the results generated from either the
(1) machine learning (from model_building.py) or the
(2) statistical modelling (from stat_modelling.py) modules.

Provides users with the ability to:

1. Extract and/or save the per feature/interaction scores to disk.

2. Generate per residue scores from the per feature scores.
(This is done by summing all the feature scores that a residue is present in
and the normalizing the results so that the top residue has a score of 1).

3. Obtain (and/or save) the kernel density estimations made for each feature.
(only available for binary classification.)

4. Estimate the "direction" each feature favors by calculating the average PyContact score
for each feature and each class (only available for binary classification).
Whatever feature has the highest average score is chosen (warning, very approximate method).
