"Hbond" - Hydrogen bond
"Saltbr" - Salt Bridge
"Hydrophobic" - VdW interaction between two hydrophobic residues.

    ----------

    parm_file: str
        The file path to your topology file. All MDAnalysis allowed topologies can be used.
        Please do not use a PDB file for this, use something with charge information.
        This is important for the hydrogen bonding part of the calculation to work.

    traj_file: str
        The file path to your trajectory file.
        All MDAnalysis allowed trajectory file types can be used.

    out_file: str
        Path to write the csv output file too.

    first_res: Optional[int]
        First residue to analyse, useful if you want to break the analysis into blocks.
        If not provided, the first residue in the trajectory will be used.

    last_res: Optional[int]
        Last residue to analyse, useful if you want to break the analysis into blocks.
        If not provided, the last residue in the trajectory will be used.

    report_timings: bool = True
        Choose whether to print to the console how long the job took to run.
        Optional, default is True.
